Introduction

SQL is a powerful language used for managing relational databases. This repository serves as a platform to highlight my proficiency in SQL and showcases my ability to design efficient database schemas, write complex queries, and optimize database performance.

The contents of this repository include a wide range of topics such as data modeling, data manipulation, data retrieval, database administration, and performance tuning. By exploring the SQL scripts, database designs, and query optimizations, you will gain insight into my approach to SQL development and my ability to work with various database management systems.
#
Repository Structure

The SQL General Reference is organized into the following sections:

  1. **Database Design:** This section contains database schema designs and entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs). You will find examples of well-structured database designs, normalization techniques, and best practices for building efficient and scalable databases.

  2. **Data Manipulation:** Here, you will find SQL scripts that demonstrate data manipulation operations such as inserting, updating, and deleting data in the database. These scripts showcase my ability to handle data transformations, perform batch operations, and maintain data integrity.

  3. **Data Retrieval:** The data retrieval section focuses on SQL queries for extracting data from the database. You will find examples of simple and complex queries, including joins, subqueries, aggregations, and advanced filtering techniques. These scripts demonstrate my proficiency in retrieving the required information from the database efficiently.

  4. **Database Administration:** In this section, you will find scripts and guides related to database administration tasks. This includes database creation, table creation, user management, access control, backups, and recovery. These scripts highlight my knowledge of database management systems and my ability to maintain and secure databases.

  5. **Query Optimization:** The query optimization section provides SQL scripts and techniques for improving query performance. You will find examples of query tuning, index optimization, query rewriting, and caching strategies. These scripts demonstrate my ability to optimize queries and enhance database performance.

  6. **Database Migration:** Here, you will find scripts and guides for database migration tasks, including transferring data between different database systems, upgrading database versions, and migrating from one schema design to another. These scripts showcase my expertise in handling complex data migration scenarios.
